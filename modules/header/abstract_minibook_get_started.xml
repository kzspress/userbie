<para><citetitle>Get Started on Linux in 45 Minutes</citetitle> will
gently and humorously introduce you to the useful art of controlling a Linux
computer using the keyboard, rather than the mouse. It comes in the form of a
quick-start guide, which should take about 45 minutes to read.  In addition,
it is combined with practical exercises, which should take about 90 minutes
to do.</para>

<para>This minibook is a part of a full-length book, entitled <citetitle>Linux
Doesn't Have to Be Hard: A Beginner's Guide</citetitle>, comprehensively
covering not only the command line, but also other fundamental Linux
features. The full-length book has not been published yet and is currently
a work in progress. If you like this quick-start guide, please subscribe to

<para>A crowdfunding campaign will be organised to fund the publication of
the full-length book. Please subscribe to the newsletter above for information

<para>This guide, as well as the full-length book, are intended for novice

are advised to read it next to a Linux machine, so that you can immediately
practice what you learn.</para>

<para>This quick-start guide covers accessing and searching the Linux
