<preface><title>Preface</title>

<para>This guide belongs to the <citetitle>Userbie</citetitle> series of
books. The series is unlike any other. It is available gratis and is intended
to be developed collaboratively and indefinitely.</para>

<para>The Old Norse suffix <emphasis>-bie</emphasis> means a village or
settlement. Userbie means <emphasis>a village of users</emphasis>. The word
Userbie also rhymes with the word newbie.</para>

<para>The updating, editing and publishing of the books will be crowdfunded. If
you like this book and would like to see more, please join the crowdfunding
campaign. To receive information about the campaign, subscribe to the <ulink

<para>The book's collaborative development process has been inspired by the
Linux community. The community relies on Linus Torvalds as the maintainer
of the Linux project. Anyone can offer feedback or a contribution to Linux,
but Linus Torvalds and his trusted team decide if the proposed change gets
incorporated into the project. This ensures that you can trust the code.</para>

<para>Anyone can also offer feedback or a contribution to this book, but the
Userbie maintenance team decides if the proposed change gets incorporated
into the book. This ensures that you can trust the content.</para>

<para>I hope that you will find this book helpful
and will join us in its further development on <ulink
url="https://userbie.com">userbie.com</ulink>. Enjoy and have fun with
Linux!</para>
