## Get Started on Linux by End of Tonight
### Without Breaking Your Box – A Userbie Guide

Do you want to get up and running on Linux by end of tonight? You can do
this with this book.

We’re going to walk you step-by-step through installing Linux on your
computer without affecting your current operating system. You’ll install
Linux in a virtual machine, the simplest way to use Linux alongside your
current environment. We’ll then show you how to poke around the system,
keeping you busy until dawn, if you want us to :]

Why would you want to have Linux on your computer? There’re plenty of
reasons. Maybe you’re thinking about a lucrative career as a systems
administrator – we can get you started on that path. Or maybe you want to
get the liberating feeling, the pride of having an open-source operating
system on your computer, free from the lock-in of proprietary systems –
we can help you with that. Or perhaps you just want to get your job done
with Linux – we’ll show you how to get it done fast, whether you’re
a student or a professional.

By the end of this book, you’re going to have a working Linux environment,
will know how to find the information you need in the standard Linux manuals
and how to poke around files and directories – plenty of information to
manage files on a real-world web hosting account, for instance.
