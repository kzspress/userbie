<para>Once you've put a file system on a partition, you can <command>mount</command><indexterm><primary>mount(1)</primary></indexterm> it. Mounting a file system makes it available for use, usually as a directory. We say <command>mounting a file system</command><indexterm><primary>mounting</primary></indexterm> instead of mounting a partition because we will see later that we can also mount file systems that do not exists on partitions.</para>
<para>On all <command>Unix</command> systems, every file and every directory is part of one big file tree. To access a file, you need to know the full path starting from the root directory. When adding a <command>file system</command> to your computer, you need to make it available somewhere in the file tree. The directory where you make a file system available is called a <command>mount point</command><indexterm><primary>mount point</primary></indexterm>.</para>
