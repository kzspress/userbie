<section><title>solution: ssh</title>
	<para>0. Make sure that you have access to <command>two Linux computers</command>, or work together with a partner for this exercise. For this practice, we will name one of the machines the server.</para>
	<para>1. Install <command>sshd</command> on the server</para>
	<screen>apt-get install openssh-server (on Ubuntu/Debian)
yum -y install openssh-server (on Centos/Fedora/Red Hat)</screen>
	<para>2. Verify in the ssh configuration files that only protocol version 2 is allowed.</para>
	<screen>grep Protocol /etc/ssh/ssh*_config</screen>
	<para>3. Use <command>ssh</command> to log on to the server, show your current directory and then exit the server.</para>
	<screen>user@client$ ssh user@server-ip-address
user@server$ pwd
/home/user
user@server$ exit</screen>
	<para>4. Use <command>scp</command> to copy a file from your computer to the server.</para>
	<screen>scp localfile user@server:~</screen>
	<para>5. Use <command>scp</command> to copy a file from the server to your computer.</para>
	<screen>scp user@server:~/serverfile .</screen>
	<para>6. (optional, only works when you have a graphical install of Linux) Install the xeyes package on the server and use ssh to run xeyes on the server, but display it on your client. </para>
	<screen>on the server:
apt-get install xeyes
on the client:
ssh -X user@server-ip
xeyes</screen>
	<para>7. (optional, same as previous) Create a bookmark in firefox, then quit firefox on client and server. Use <command>ssh -X</command> to run firefox on your display, but on your neighbour's computer. Do you see your neighbour's bookmark ?</para>
	<para>8. Use <command>ssh-keygen</command> to create a key pair without passphrase. Setup passwordless ssh between you and your neighbour. (or between your client and your server)</para>
	<screen>See solution in book "setting up passwordless ssh"</screen>
	<para>9. Verify that the permissions on the server key files are correct; world readable for the public keys and only root access for the private keys.</para>
	<screen>ls -l /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*</screen>
	<para>10. Verify that the <command>ssh-agent</command> is running.</para>
	<screen>ps fax | grep ssh-agent</screen>
	<para>11. (optional) Protect your keypair with a <command>passphrase</command>, then add this key to the <command>ssh-agent</command> and test your passwordless ssh to the server.</para>
	<screen>man ssh-keygen
man ssh-agent
man ssh-add</screen>
