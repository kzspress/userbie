<para>Most <command>lvm</command> implementations support <command>physical storage grouping</command><indexterm><primary>LVM</primary></indexterm>, <command>logical volume resizing</command> and <command>data migration</command>. </para>
<para>Physical storage grouping is a fancy name for grouping multiple block devices (hard disks, but also iSCSI etc) into a logical mass storage device. To enlarge this physical group, block devices (including partitions) can be added at a later time.</para>
<para>The size of <command>lvm volumes</command> on this <command>physical group</command> is independent of the individual size of the components. The total size of the group is the limit.</para>
<para>One of the nice features of <command>lvm</command> is the logical volume resizing. You can increase the size of an <command>lvm volume</command>, sometimes even without any downtime. Additionally, you can migrate data away from a failing hard disk device, create mirrors and create snapshots.</para>
