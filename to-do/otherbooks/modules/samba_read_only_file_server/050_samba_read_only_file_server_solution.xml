<section><title>solution: read only file server</title>
	<para>1. Create a directory in a good location (FHS) to share files for everyone to read.</para>
	<screen>choose one of these...</screen>
	<screen>mkdir -p /srv/samba/readonly</screen>
	<screen>mkdir -p /home/samba/readonly</screen>
	<screen>/home/paul/readonly is wrong!!</screen>
	<screen>/etc/samba/readonly is wrong!!</screen>
	<screen>/readonly is wrong!!</screen>
	<para>2. Make sure the directory is owned properly and is world accessible.</para>
	<screen>chown root:root /srv/samba/readonly</screen>
	<screen>chmod 755 /srv/samba/readonly</screen>
	<para>3. Put a textfile in this directory.</para>
	<screen>echo Hello World > hello.txt</screen>
	<para>4. Share the directory with Samba.</para>
	<screen>
You smb.conf.readonly could look like this:
[global]
 workgroup = WORKGROUP
 server string = Read Only File Server
 netbios name = STUDENTx
 security = share

[readonlyX]
 path = /srv/samba/readonly
 comment = read only file share
 read only = yes
 guest ok = yes
	</screen>
	<screen>test with testparm before going in production!</screen>
	<para>5. Verify from your own and from another computer (smbclient, net use, ...) that the share is accessible for reading.</para>
	<screen>On Linux: smbclient -NL 127.0.0.1</screen>
	<screen>On Windows Explorer: browse to My Network Places</screen>
	<screen>On Windows cmd.exe: net use L: //studentx/readonly</screen>
	<para>6. Make a backup copy of your smb.conf, name it smb.conf.ReadOnlyFileServer.</para>
	<screen>cp smb.conf smb.conf.ReadOnlyFileServer</screen>
