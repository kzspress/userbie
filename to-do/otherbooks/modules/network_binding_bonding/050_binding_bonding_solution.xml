	<para>1. Add an extra <command>ip address</command> to one of your network cards. Test that it works (have your neighbour ssh to it)!</para>
	<screen>Redhat/Fedora:
add an /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX:X file
as shown in the theory</screen>
	<screen>Debian/Ubuntu:
expand the /etc/network/interfaces file
as shown in the theory</screen>
	<para>2. Use <command>ifdown</command> to disable this extra <command>ip address</command>.</para>
	<screen>ifdown eth0:0</screen>
	<para>3. Make sure your neighbour also succeeded in <command>binding</command> an extra ip address before you continue.</para>
	<screen>ping $extra_ip_neighbour
or
ssh $extra_ip_neighbour</screen>
	<para>4. Add an extra network card (or two) to your virtual machine and use the theory to <command>bond</command> two network cards.</para>
	<screen>Redhat/Fedora:
add ifcfg-ethX and ifcfg-bondX files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
as shown in the theory
and don't forget the modprobe.conf</screen>
