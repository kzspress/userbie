	<para>1. Create two files named winter.txt and summer.txt, put some text in them.</para>
	<screen>echo cold > winter.txt ; echo hot > summer.txt</screen>
	<para>2. Create a hard link to winter.txt named hlwinter.txt.</para>
	<screen>ln winter.txt hlwinter.txt</screen>
	<para>3. Display the inode numbers of these three files, the hard links should have the same inode.</para>
	<screen>ls -li winter.txt summer.txt hlwinter.txt</screen>
	<para>4. Use the find command to list the two hardlinked files</para>
	<screen>find . -inum xyz #replace xyz with the inode number</screen>
	<para>5. Everything about a file is in the inode, except two things : name them!</para>
	<para>The name of the file is in a directory, and the contents is somewhere on the disk.</para>
	<para>6. Create a symbolic link to summer.txt called slsummer.txt.</para>
	<screen>ln -s summer.txt slsummer.txt</screen>
	<para>7. Find all files with inode number 2. What does this information tell you ?</para>
	<para>It tells you there is more than one inode table (one for every formatted partition + virtual file systems)</para>
	<para>8. Look at the directories /etc/init.d/ /etc/rc.d/ /etc/rc3.d/ ... do you see the links ?</para>
	<screen>ls -l /etc/init.d</screen>
	<screen>ls -l /etc/rc2.d</screen>
	<screen>ls -l /etc/rc3.d</screen>
	<para>9. Look in /lib with ls -l...</para>
	<screen>ls -l /lib</screen>
	<para>10. Use <command>find</command> to look in your home directory for regular files that have more than one hard link (hint: this is identical to all regular files that do not have exactly one hard link).</para>
	<screen>find ~ ! -links 1 -type f</screen>
